// Yes, we have this global varibles in namespace ::upnplib, but they are only
// needed as long as the old C sources not re-engeneered to C++ objects. We need
// these globals to mock calls of system functions from the old C sources
// because there is no dependency injection possible. In the production
// environment these globels are never touched after instantiation. Its objects
// wrap the system calls and are only statically used to call them.
