// =================================
/*!
 * <!-- Compatible API
 * ------------------- -->
 * \defgroup compaAPI COMPATIBLE API
 * \brief Well defined Application Programming Interface of the **compatible**
 * part of the library.
 *
 * This API is equal to the API of the old **pUPnP** System Developement Kit
 * (SDK). It drop in replaces the API of the old **pUPnP** SDK. If the default
 * usage of this Interface does not behave like the old one then it should be
 * reported as an issue. Differences may exist with error conditions due to bug
 * fixes and stability enhacements. This ensures that you can direct use
 * **UPnPlib** instead **pUPnP** without changes to your source code. Then you
 * can modify your source code step by step or only when needed, to use the new
 * object oriented features of the completely rewritten **UPnPlib**.
 *
 * This feature is only to ease the port to the new library but support will be
 * discontinued after some time of transition. It is not intended to continue
 * supporting this. With starting a new software project it is strongly
 * recommended to only use the new object oriented **UPnPlib API**.

 * \defgroup compa compatible UPnP SDK
 * \brief Detailed documentation of this part of the library. Not of interest
 * for only using the SDK.
 *
 * This is only for users/developers who want to take a look behind the scenes
 * and have deeper insight. The description of the API is sufficient to use the
 * library.
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Addressing Step 0: Addressing
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items to get a network address for UPnP devices and control points.
 *
 * Addressing is Step 0 of UPnP networking. Through addressing, devices
 * and control points get a network address. Addressing enables discovery (Step
 * 1) where control points find interesting device(s), description (Step 2)
 * where control points learn about device capabilities, control (Step 3) where
 * a control point sends commands to device(s), eventing (Step 4) where control
 * points listen to state changes in device(s), and presentation (Step 5) where
 * control points display a user interface for device(s).
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Discovery Step 1: Discovery
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items for control points to find UPnP device(s) with **SSDP** the
 * *Simple Service Discovery Protocol*.
 *
 * Discovery is Step 1 in UPnP networking. Discovery comes after addressing
 * (Step 0) where devices get a network address. Through discovery, control
 * points find interesting device(s). Discovery enables description (Step 2)
 * where control points learn about device capabilities, control (Step 3) where
 * a control point sends commands to device(s), eventing (Step 4) where control
 * points listen to state changes in device(s), and presentation (Step 5) where
 * control points display a user interface for device(s).
 *
 * \defgroup SSDP-Data SSDP Data
 * \ingroup compa-Discovery
 * \brief Constants, variables, trivial structures to manage SSDP discovery
 *
 * \defgroup SSDP-common_functions SSDP Common Functions
 * \ingroup compa-Discovery
 * \brief Functions that are commonly used for SSDP Discovery.
 * \details These functions are needed for both SSDP Devices and SSDP Control
 * Points, for example to network read or write to/from an SSDP socket. They are
 * conditional compiled with\n
 * `#if INCLUDE_DEVICE_APIS == 1 || INCLUDE_CLIENT_APIS == 1`
 *
 * \defgroup SSDP-device_functions SSDP Device Functions
 * \ingroup compa-Discovery
 * \brief Functions to manage SSDP for UPnP Devices.
 *
 * \defgroup SSDP-ctrlpt_functions SSDP Control Point Functions
 * \ingroup compa-Discovery
 * \brief Functions to manage SSDP for UPnP Control Points.
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Description Step 2: Description
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items for control points to learn more about a UPnP device and its
 * capabilities.
 *
 * Description is Step 2 in UPnP networking. Description comes after addressing
 * (Step 0) where devices get a network address, and after discovery (Step 1)
 * where control points find interesting device(s). Description enables control
 * (Step 3) where control points send commands to device(s), eventing (Step 4)
 * where control points listen to state changes in device(s), and presentation
 * (Step 5) where control points may display an html user interface for
 * device(s).
 *
 * After a control point has discovered a device, the control point still knows
 * very little about the device. For the control point to learn more about the
 * device and its capabilities, or to interact with the device, the control
 * point shall retrieve a description of the device and its capabilities from
 * the URL provided by the device in the discovery message.
 *
 * \defgroup Description-ctrlpt Request from control point
 * \ingroup compa-Description
 * \brief Items for a request of a control point to get a description from a device.
 *
 * \defgroup Description-device Description from device
 * \ingroup compa-Description
 * \brief Items to describe a device for responding to a control points request.
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Control Step 3: Control
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items for control points to invoke actions on UPnP devices with
 * **SOAP** the *Simple Object Access Protocol*.
 *
 * Control is Step 3 in UPnP networking. Control comes after addressing (Step 0)
 * where devices get a network address, after discovery (Step 1) where control
 * points find interesting device(s), and after description (Step 2) where
 * control points learn about device capabilities. Control is independent of
 * eventing (Step 4) where control points listen to state changes in device(s).
 * Through control, control points invoke actions on devices and poll for
 * values. Control and eventing are complementary to presentation (Step 5) where
 * control points display a user interface provided by device(s).
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Eventing Step 4: Eventing
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items to manage events with **GENA** the *General Event Notification
 * Architecture*.
 *
 * Eventing is Step 4 in UPnP networking. Eventing comes after addressing (Step
 * 0) where devices get a network address, after discovery (Step 1) where
 * control points find interesting device(s), and after description (Step 2)
 * where control points learn about device capabilities. Eventing is intimately
 * linked with control (Step 3) where control points send actions to devices.
 * Through eventing, control points listen to state changes in device(s).
 * Control and eventing are complementary to presentation (Step 5) where control
 * points display a user interface provided by device(s).
 *
 *
 * \defgroup compa-Presentation Step 5: Presentation
 * \ingroup compa
 * \brief Items for control points to expose an HTML-based user interface for
 * controlling and/or viewing device status.
 *
 * Presentation is Step 5 in UPnP networking. Presentation comes after
 * addressing (Step 0) where devices get network addresses, after discovery
 * (Step 1) where control points find interesting device(s), and after
 * description (Step 2) where control points learn about device capabilities.
 * Presentation exposes an HTML-based user interface for controlling and/or
 * viewing device status. Presentation is complementary to control (Step 3)
 * where control points send actions to devices, and eventing (Step 4) where
 * control points listen to state changes in device(s).
 *
