Next steps to do:
* Build gtests with libraries
* Remove dependency of upnplib from 'upnpconfig.hpp'.
* Remove 'upnp.hpp' dependeny from './core/src/api/upnplib/upnptools.cpp'
* Remove 'uri.hpp' dependeny from './include/upnplib/uri.hpp'
* Some gtests fail on MS Windows with system error 135 using
    Build Type Debug. Fix it.
* Bugreport to gtest: EXPECT_THAT THROW shouldn't call two times if no match.
* Install doxygen.
* Create own Url class.
