     * Usually this setter is called one time after constructing the object.
     * This gets an address information from the operating system that may also
     * use its internal name resolver inclusive contacting external DNS server.
     * If you use the flag **AI_NUMERICHOST** with the constructor then a
     * possible expensive name resolution to DNS server is suppressed.
     *
     * Because always the same cached hints given with the constructor are used
     * we also get the same information but with new allocated memory. So it
     * doesn't make much sense to call it more than one time, but doesn't hurt
     * except waste of resources.

     * \exception std::runtime_error Failed to get address information, node or
     * service not known. Maybe an alphanumeric node name that cannot be

     * or socket type not supported, etc.
     *
     * Provides strong exception guarantee. It should be noted that are
