// This destructor can also be defined direct in the header file as usual but
// then the symbol is included and not linked. We have to decorate the symbol
// with __declspec(dllexport) on Microsoft Windows in a header file that
// normaly import symbols. It does not conform to the visibility macro
// UPNPLIB_API and would require other advanced special handling. So we link
// the symbol with this source file so it do the right think with it. --Ingo
