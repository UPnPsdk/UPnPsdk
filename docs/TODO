Next steps to do:
* Remove core/src/genlib subdirectory and move 'struct SockAddr'
* Move ./build/_deps/pthreads4w-build/pthread* etc. to default build directories.
* Make UpnpPrintf() usable without build type DEBUG.
* Create gtests for get_ssdp_sockets (needed for miniserver).
* Rework README.md.
* Bugreport to gtest: EXPECT_THAT THROW shouldn't call two times if no match.
* Install doxygen.
* Create own Url class.
