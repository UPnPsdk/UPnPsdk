 * milliseconds (5 seconds).

 * than this, then a new thread (up to the max) will be allocated to the thread
 * pool. The default ratio is 10 jobs/thread.

 * applications built on top of the SDK and also for making connections to
 * other control points and devices. This number includes persistent threads.
 * The default value is two threads.

 * connections to other control points and devices. It is not recommended that
 * this value be below 10, since the threads are necessary for correct
 * operation. This value can be increased for greater performance in operation
 * at the expense of greater memory overhead. The default value is 12.
 */

 * bytes) allocated for the stack of each thread the thread pool inside the SDK
 * will create. These threads are used for both callbacks into applications
 * built on top of the library and also for making connections to other control
 * points and devices. This value will not be used if it is lower than

 * have no effect in most situations with the default (low) value of
 * MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_QUEUED_EVENTS. However, if MAX_SUBSCRIPTION_QUEUED_EVENTS

 * good conformance with the UPnP Device Architecture standard, at the
 * price of higher potential memory use.

 * \brief The `AUTO_RENEW_TIME` is the time, in seconds, before a subscription
 * expires that the SDK automatically resubscribes. The default value is 10

 * not making it to the device in time, causing the subscription to timeout. In
 * order to avoid continually resubscribing the minimum subscription time is
 * five seconds more than the auto renew time.

 * will wait on the socket to read for an answer from the CP. By putting a
