# The UPnP Library
**Under developement!**  
Not usable at time. README.md only as draft, work in progress.

## 1. Overview
This is a fork of the [Portable SDK for UPnP Devices (pupnp)](https://github.com/pupnp/) with the aim of a complete re-engeneering. The following general goals are in progress or planned:
- Drop in compatibillity with the old pupnp library
- Continue optimization for embedded devices
- Based on C++ instead of C
- Object oriented programming
- Unit-Test driven developement
- Using only cmake for installation
- Emphasis on IPv6 support

## 2. Build Instructions
### 2.1. Linux
t.b.d.

### 2.2. Microsoft Windows Build
The developement of this UPnP Library has started on Linux. So for historical reasons it uses POSIX threads (pthreads) as specified by [The Open Group](http://get.posixcertified.ieee.org/certification_guide.html). Unfortunately Microsoft Windows does not support it so we have to use a third party library. We use the well known and well supported [pthreads4w library](https://sourceforge.net/p/pthreads4w). To keep things simple for you I have copied the latest stable version archive to this project. It will be build with the installation of this project and should do out of the box. This archive will always be downloaded but deleted on other systems than MS Windows.

## 3. Configure Options for cmake
Following the default options are shown.

- -D GOOGLETEST=OFF     Enables installation of GoogleTest for Unit-Tests.

- -D DEVEL=OFF          This enables some additional information for developement. It preserves installation options that normaly will be deleted after Installation for Optimisation so you can examine them. These are mainly the installation directory from **pthread4w** and its temporary installation files even on a non MS Windows environment.

- -D DEBUG=OFF          By default the RELEASE version is build. If you set DEBUG=ON you will have additional developement support: the mnemonic program symbols are compiled into the binary programs so you can better examine the code and simply debug it. But I think you should not use a debugger. Instead write a Unit test. Compiling with symbols increases the program size a big amount. With focus on embedded devices this is not good idea.  
**TODO:** There is a problem building with symbols at the cmake configuration stage. On MS Windows it must set on the build stage, e.g. `cmake --build build --config Debug`. This cannot be done with this option.
