// Yes, we have this global varibles, but they are only needed as long as the
// old C sources not re-engeneered to C++ objects. We need these globals to mock
// calls of system functions from the old C sources because there is no
// dependency injection possible. In the production environment these globels
// are never touched after instantiation. Its objects wrap the system calls and
// are only statically used to call them.
