Next steps to do:
* Rework pthreads4w build to compile with 32 bit.
* Rework Github Actions to detect gtest fails on 32 bit MS Windows.
* Check bugfix in pupnp/upnp/src/urlconfig/urlconfig.cpp with a gtest.
* [set EXPECT_CALL to redirect the call to the original method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25556601/set-expect-call-to-redirect-the-call-to-the-original-method)
* Rework miniserver GTest including sources like webserver.
* Continue creating gtests for webserver.
* Move pupnp/upnp/src/inc/sock.hpp:79:static UPNP_INLINE int sock_close() to miniserver.cpp and rework.
* Check usage of fields in struct s_SocketStuff.serverAddr4.
* Make UpnpPrintf() usable without build type DEBUG.
* Create gtests for get_ssdp_sockets (needed for miniserver).
* Rework README.md.
* Bugreport to gtest: EXPECT_THAT THROW shouldn't call two times if no match.
* Install doxygen.
* Create own Url class.
