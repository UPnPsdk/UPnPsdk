Next steps to do:
* Rework test_UpnpString.cpp
* Move pupnp/upnp/src/inc/sock.hpp:79:static UPNP_INLINE int sock_close() to miniserver.cpp and rework.
* Check usage of fields in struct s_SocketStuff.serverAddr4.
* Make UpnpPrintf() usable without build type DEBUG.
* Create gtests for get_ssdp_sockets (needed for miniserver).
* Rework README.md.
* Bugreport to gtest: EXPECT_THAT THROW shouldn't call two times if no match.
* Install doxygen.
* Create own Url class.
