     *
     * Usually this getter is called one time after constructing the object.
     * This gets an address information from the operating system that may also
     * use its internal name resolver inclusive contacting external DNS server.
     * If you use the flag **AI_NUMERICHOST** with the constructor then a
     * possible expensive name resolution to DNS server is suppressed.
     *
     * If you have iterated address information entries with
     * CAddrinfo::get_next() and want to restart you can do it with call
     * CAddrinfo::get_first() again. It will read the information from the
     * operating system again and could be used to monitor changes of address
     * information. But note that this is quite expensive because always memory
     * is freed and new allocated for the information list so doing this in a
     * busy loop is not very useful.

     * number is a numeric value but out of valid range 0..65535. This
     * exception is derived from std::runtime_error.
