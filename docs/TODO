Next steps to do:
* Make include directories target specific, means to use
    'target_include_directories'.
* Remove dependency of upnplib from 'upnpconfig.hpp'.
* Rework and optimize CMake configuration and build.
* Remove 'upnp.hpp' dependeny from 'core/src/api/upnplib/upnptools.cpp'
* Some gtests fail on MS Windows with system error 135 using
    Build Type Debug. Fix it.
* Bugreport to gtest: EXPECT_THAT THROW shouldn't call two times if no match.
