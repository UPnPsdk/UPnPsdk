# Sample to use the UPnPlib

Very little hacking is needed to understand how this work. Run `./tv_device` in one window and `./tv_ctrlpt` in another. `./tv_device` is the server and sits there. The only command it accepts is exit. `./tv_ctrlpt` accepts help and you can go from there. It is a fake TV device that is remotely UPNP controlled. They do all the basic UPNP functionality.
