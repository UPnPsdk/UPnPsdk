# Switches for this Subproject
#-----------------------------
# These switches are all handled only in this configuration file.

# Options selectable by user configuration
# To build all samples by default then use:
# cmake -S . -B build -D UPNPLIB_WITH_SAMPLES=YES
# To build only a single sample for testing and internal use you can do e.g.:
# cmake -S . -B build -D UPNPLIB_DEF_SAMPLES=YES -D UPNPLIB_DEF_SAMPLE_CLIENT=YES
