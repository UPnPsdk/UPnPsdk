 */

/*!
 * \brief The socket module contains all classes and free functions to manage
 * network sockets.
 * \addtogroup upnplib-socket
 *
 * This module mainly consists of the CSocket class but
 * also provides free functions to manage a socket. The problem is that socket
 * handling isn't very good portable. There is different behavior on the
 * supported platforms Unix, MacOS and Microsoft Windows. The CSocket class
 * atempts to be consistent portable on all three platforms by using common
 * behavior or by emulating missing functions on a platform.
 *
 * Specification for CSocket
 * =========================
 * The class encapsulates and manages one raw socket file descriptor. The file
 * descriptor of a valid socket object cannot be changed but the object with
 * its immutable file descriptor can be moved and assigned to another socket
 * object. Copying a socket object isn't supported because having two objects
 * with the same file descriptor may be very error prone in particular with
 * multithreading. Effort has been taken to do not cache any socket information
 * outside the socket file descriptor. All socket informations are direct set
 * and get to/from the operating system with the file descriptor. The socket
 * file descriptor is always valid except on an empty socket object.
 *
 * \anchor empty_socket
 * empty socket object
 * -------------------
 * An empty socket object can be instantiated with the default constructor,
 * e.g. `CSocket sockObj;`. It is a valid object and should be destructed. When
 * moving a socket object, the left over source object is also empty. An empty
 * socket object has an `INVALID_SOCKET` defined and no valid content. It
 * throws an exception if using any of its Setter and Getter. Moving and
 * assigning it is possible.
 *
 * protocol family
 * ---------------
 * Only protocol family `PF_INET6` and `PF_INET` is supported. Any other
 * address family throws an exception.
 *
 * socket type
 * -----------
 * Only `SOCK_STREAM` and `SOCK_DGRAM` is supported. Any other type throws an
 * exception.
 *
 * valid socket file descriptor
 * ----------------------------
 * I get this from the C standard library function:
 * `int ::%socket(address_family, socket_type, protocol)`.
 * Other arguments than address family and socket type do not instantiate a
 * valid socket object and throw an exception. For the protocol argument is
 * always the default one used that is internal hard coded with argument 0.
 *
 * options SO_REUSEADDR and SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE
 * --------------------------------------------
 * I don't set the option to immediately reuse an address and I always set the
 * option `SO_EXCLUSIVEADDRUSE` on Microsoft Windows. For more details of this
 * have a look at [Socket option "reuse address"](\ref overview_reuseaddr).

 * \ingroup upnplib-socket
 *
 * This class takes the resources and results as given by the platform (Unix,
 * MacOS, MS Windows). It does not perform any emulations for unification. The
 * behavior can be different on different platforms.
 *
 * An object of this class does not take ownership of the raw socket file
 * descriptor and will never close it. This is also the reason why you cannot
 * modify the socket and only have getter available (except the setter 'init()'
 * for the raw socket file descriptor itself). But it is helpful to easily get
 * information about an existing raw socket file descriptor. Closing the file
 * descriptor is in the responsibility of the caller who created the socket. If
 * you need to manage a socket you must use CSocket.
