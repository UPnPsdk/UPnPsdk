Next steps to do:
* Rework test_sock.cpp to work with changed sys_socket mocking.
* Enable CSigpipe@sock.cpp for MacOS and create tests for it.
* Fix time to receive or send data on sock_read_write()@sock.cpp.
* Remove a_service argument from CAddrinfo constructor.
* Enable test_sock_openssl.cpp again.
* Rework test_httpreadwrite.cpp.
* Reduce size of shared libraries.
* Use poll() and WSAPoll() instead of select().
* Add AI_IDN and AI_CANONIDN support to CAddrinfo.
* Improve CAddrinfo to support more than one address info (use *ai_next). It needs extended mocking.
* Improve test_sock.cpp with ssl tests
* Improve test_http_Download.cpp, start with error conditions for http_MakeMessage()
* Create gtests for ssdp/*, start with get_ssdp_sockets (needed for miniserver).
* parse_uri should except "http://127.000.000.001:50001/tvdevicedesc.xml" as valid.
* Create gtests for web_server_callback.
* Check bugfix in pupnp/upnp/src/urlconfig/urlconfig.cpp with a gtest.
* [set EXPECT_CALL to redirect the call to the original method](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25556601/set-expect-call-to-redirect-the-call-to-the-original-method)
* Move pupnp/upnp/src/inc/sock.hpp:79:static UPNP_INLINE int sock_close() to miniserver.cpp and rework.
* Check if all fields in struct s_SocketStuff.serverAddr4 are used.
* Rework README.md.
* Install doxygen.
* Create own Url class.
* Replace ThreadPool and multithreading with C++ standard library functions.
